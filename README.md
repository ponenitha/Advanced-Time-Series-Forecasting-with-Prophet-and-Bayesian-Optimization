# advanced-time-series-forecasting-deep-learning-explainability
This project implements a complete pipeline for multivariate time-series forecasting using both classical statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet) and a deep learning Transformer model. The dataset is synthetically generated to simulate real-world non-stationary sensor/financial patterns.
